Contents of MSA and MSA.zip are exactly the same. MSA folder enable you to browse MSA.zip online without actually download it. MSA.zip is the complete code package for PES fitting using MSA. It is a Bowman Group Product. 

# In order to use MSA:

1. Download zip file.
2. Unzip the file. (You can use command 'unzip MSA.zip' )
3. Read the readme.txt inside zip file.

# About MSA

MSA is a software that does a fit of electronic energies using fitting bases that are invariant with respect to permutations of like atoms. The detailed theory is discussed in the Xie and Bowman paper (see reference). The software also provides the potential gradient, if desired.
